    "### Alternative Hypothesis\n",
    "\n",
    "The alternative hypothesis in a two-sample location problem typically states that $Y$ is generally larger (or smaller) than $X$. One useful model for this is the **translation model**, also called the **location-shift model**:\n",

If $X$ is from population 1 (control) and $Y$ is from population 2 (treatment), then $\\Delta$ represents the **expected effect of the treatment**. If the mean $E(X)$ of population 1 exists, and $E(Y)$ is the mean of population 2, then:\n",

    "\n",
    "   - **Interpretation**: The distribution underlying $X$ is stochastically **less than** that of $Y$. In other words, $X$ tends to take on smaller values compared to $Y$.

Even though the direction of the inequalities might seem counterintuitive, they correctly indicate that if $F(t) > G(t)$, samples drawn from $X$ tends to be less than those drawn from $Y$.
